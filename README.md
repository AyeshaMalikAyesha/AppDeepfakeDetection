# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning(ResNeXt50 and LSTM)

# Give a Star⭐ to Repo

This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNeXt50 and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.

You can clone this flutter application.
#Key Features:
The features in our app is:

💡 𝑨𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒚: We achieved an accuracy of 93% on training set and 75% on test set.

💡 𝑨𝒅𝒗𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒅 𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏: Utilizing cutting-edge AI and machine learning algorithms, our app can accurately identify deepfake videos 
   and images.
   
💡 𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍-𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔: Get instant results with our high-speed processing, ensuring you can verify content quickly and efficiently.

💡 𝑼𝒔𝒆𝒓-𝑭𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒍𝒚 𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒆: Our app is designed with ease of use in mind, making deepfake detection accessible to everyone, from tech experts to everyday users.

💡 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒉𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝑹𝒆𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈: Receive detailed reports on the detected deepfakes, providing insights into the authenticity of the media.

💡 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑭𝒐𝒓𝒖𝒎: Our forum is a dynamic, interactive space designed for users, experts, and enthusiasts of our deepfake detection app.


api.py file contains the API in which http request from flutter app is passed to server through api where preprocessing and prediction occur.

#Model Training

For preprocessing of videos and model Training we used the code from <a href='https://github.com/abhijitjadhav1998/Deepfake_detection_using_deep_learning'>this Github repo</a>

#Demo

You can watch the video for demo:
