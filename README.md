# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning(ResNeXt50 and LSTM)

# Give a Star‚≠ê to Repo

This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNeXt50 and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.

You can clone this flutter application.

api.py file contains the API.

#Model Training

For preprocessing of videos and model Training we used the code from <a href='https://github.com/abhijitjadhav1998/Deepfake_detection_using_deep_learning'>this Github repo</a>:
